Files and logic that deploy my personal system config.

It's designed to be called via [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-pull.html][ansible-pull]] from the local machine.

* Why
- I want to be able to deploy my config as quickly and painlessly as possible on new machines.
- I want to configure my system in a declarative way, like NixOS or Guix.
- But I want to use Archlinux
  - I've been using it for years
  - I want rolling releases
  - I like pacman
  - I like how they approach packaging
  - I like the AUR
  - I want to compile myself as few packages as possible
    - And when I have to I want to do it with a PKGBUILD
  - Documentation is great
